### Simulator Web Application
This project was part of a Big data project developed by 4 Junior Java developers and a Senior developer that guided us.  
It is a Web application that simulate a virtual economic environment formed by companies that buy and sell products and  
service. These companies act in function of certain parameters and strategies to get the highest benefits and maintaining  
the rules and laws in the reality (e.g. Minimum salaries for the employers).
During the execution the simulator will generate a high volume of invoices or bills that can be analyzed by other  
programs or processed by Big data applications, like in the case of this project. The rest of the modules of the main  
project use these invoices to generate reports about taxes automatically or to calculate the financial state of the companies.
